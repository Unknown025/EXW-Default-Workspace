This is a default workspace to begin working with Expansive Weaponry.

### To get started
Make sure you have JDK 8 installed (newer versions likely WILL NOT work). Using Eclipse/IntelliJ, open this project's build.gradle file. Wait for the project to sync, before running `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`. If all goes well, your workspace is now configured!

### Working with Expansive Weaponry
Now that you have an IDE configured with both Minecraft Forge and Expansive Weaponry's source code, you can create a content pack. All of your configuration files will go into the `./run` directory, while your models will go into the `org.rainyville.modulus.client.model.<pack_name>` package (which you'll want to create).

### Getting help
Our documentation is currently available [here](https://github.com/Unknown025/ModulusConverter/tree/master/docs), which covers the available options for guns, ammo, armor, crafting, and vehicles. You can also take a look at how our official packs are created, which can be found [on our site](https://rainyville.org/expansive-weaponry/content-packs). Still need help?
